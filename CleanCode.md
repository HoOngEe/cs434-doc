## Chaper 2 : Meaningful Names
- Don't hesitate to change variable names after you find better ones.
- Try to avoid number-series(a1, a2, .. ,aN) naming which is noninformative.
- `Info` and `Data` are indistinct noise words like a, an, and the(I used to work with those variable suffixes).
  - In the similar sense, pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it.
  - It is more important not to mix similar names when a group of peopole contribute to a same code base.
- Use serachable names! (In a large project, I had a hard time searching some variables by name because of magic numberings)
- Clarity is king
- Shorter names are generally better than longer ones, so long as **they are clear**.
